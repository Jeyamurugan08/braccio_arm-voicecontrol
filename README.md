   - "Move Left"
   - "Move Right"
   - "Open Gripper"
   - "Close Gripper"
   - "Pick Item"
   - "Place Item"
   
Take note of the commands provided in the software for reference.

## 🔍 What It Does

The Braccio Arm project allows you to:

- Listen for predefined voice commands.
- Convert speech into text that the software can understand.
- Send instructions to the Arduino for controlling the Braccio servos.
- Execute various movements, including up and down, left and right, gripper actions, and pick-and-place sequences.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

The application is built using:

- **Arduino**: The microcontroller managing the robotic arm.
- **Servo Motor Control**: For precise arm movements.
- **Voice Recognition Module**: To process your spoken commands.
- **Serial Communication**: For command transfer between your computer and Arduino.
